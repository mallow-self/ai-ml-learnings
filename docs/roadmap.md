# Roadmap For AI Engineer by Tech Tim

## Build

1. OpenAI/API
2. Claude API
3. Ollama - To run local model
4. Langchain
5. LangGraph
6. Building some basic AI agents
7. Vector DB
8. Retrieval Augmented Generation

## ML Techniques

1. Regression
2. Classification
3. Clustering

- Scikit-learn
- Neural Network
- Basic Computer Vision
- Pytorch
- Tensorflow

## LLM and AI agents

1. How LLM Works:
    - GPT

        - Generative Pre-training Transformer
        - Architecture
        - LLM - what it does and what it doesn't do
        - Black box

2. No code tools:
    - crewAI, Langflow, n8n, VAPI, Livekit

3. MCP Servers
4. AI Code editors

!!! Note
    Do some real-world projects like chatbot and SaaS
