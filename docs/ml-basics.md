# What is Language Model?

- A language model is a machine learning model that aims to predict and generate plausible language. Autocomplete is a language model, for example.

- These models work by estimating the probability of a token or sequence of tokens occurring within a longer sequence of tokens. Consider the following sentence:

```markdown
When I hear rain on my roof, I _______ in my kitchen.
```

```python
int a = 10
print(a)
```
